# Fixes Applied to Easy AI Speaker Avatar System

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Gemini API Error
- **Problem**: Hardcoded API key was causing authentication errors
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded API key and disabled Gemini by default
- **Result**: System now works without requiring API key, uses fallback explanation generation

### 2. ✅ TTS Generation Pausing
- **Problem**: TTS system was pausing after each slide generation
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper error handling and retry logic (3 attempts per slide)
  - Added engine reset functionality when errors occur
  - Added file size validation to ensure audio files are created properly
  - Added timeout handling and better logging
- **Result**: TTS generation now continues smoothly without manual restarts

### 3. ✅ Wav2Lip Face Animation Errors
- **Problem**: Face animation was failing due to missing Wav2Lip setup
- **Fix**:
  - Added comprehensive file validation before processing
  - Added fallback to static video creation when Wav2Lip is not available
  - Added timeout handling (5 minutes per animation)
  - Added retry logic (2 attempts per animation)
  - Added better error reporting with command details
- **Result**: System now works even without Wav2Lip setup, creates static videos as fallback

### 4. ✅ Video Generation Issues
- **Problem**: Final video composition was failing due to file path issues
- **Fix**:
  - Added proper directory existence checks and creation
  - Added file size validation for all input files
  - Added timeout handling for ffmpeg commands (60 seconds)
  - Added better error reporting with return codes and stderr
  - Added slide duration limiting (30 seconds max per slide)
  - Added proper file matching validation
- **Result**: Video generation now works reliably with proper error handling

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Logging and Error Reporting
- **Problem**: Insufficient logging made debugging difficult
- **Fix**:
  - Added detailed logging throughout all processes
  - Added progress tracking with attempt numbers
  - Added success/failure counts for batch operations
  - Added command logging for debugging
  - Added file validation logging
- **Result**: Much better visibility into what's happening during processing

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust Error Handling**: All major functions now have comprehensive error handling
2. **Retry Logic**: Critical operations have retry mechanisms to handle temporary failures
3. **Fallback Options**: System gracefully degrades when optional components are missing
4. **Better Validation**: File existence and size checks prevent processing invalid files
5. **Timeout Protection**: All external commands have timeouts to prevent hanging
6. **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify issues quickly

## How to Use

1. **Run the system**: `python run.py`
2. **Upload files**: Use the web interface to upload PowerPoint/PDF and face image
3. **Monitor progress**: Check the terminal for detailed progress logs
4. **Download result**: Use the download button when processing is complete

## Additional Fixes (Latest Update)

### 6. ✅ TTS Stuck After Slide 2
- **Problem**: TTS engine was getting stuck after generating slide 2 audio
- **Fix**: 
  - Added engine reset after each successful audio generation
  - Added proper cleanup and wait times between operations
  - Added engine reset between retry attempts
  - Added separate TTS engine for voice previews to avoid conflicts
- **Result**: TTS now continues smoothly through all slides without getting stuck

### 7. ✅ Voice Preview Function
- **Problem**: Voice preview was just buffering and not working
- **Fix**:
  - Created separate TTS engine instance for previews
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Added file cleanup after preview generation
  - Simplified preview text for faster generation
- **Result**: Voice preview now works properly and shows actual audio

### 8. ✅ API Status Loop
- **Problem**: System was getting stuck in API status checking loop
- **Fix**:
  - Added system reset API endpoint
  - Added proper cleanup functions
  - Added TTS engine reset in cleanup
  - Added manual cleanup script for stuck states
- **Result**: System can now be reset and cleared when stuck

### 9. ✅ Status Tracking Issues
- **Problem**: System didn't properly track when each step was completed, causing it to think previous processes were still running
- **Fix**:
  - Added detailed progress tracking with step-by-step logging
  - Added proper status updates after each major operation
  - Added progress percentages for each processing step
  - Added completion confirmations for each step
- **Result**: System now properly tracks progress and moves to next steps without getting stuck

### 10. ✅ Voice Preview System
- **Problem**: Voice preview was slow and couldn't handle multiple previews simultaneously
- **Fix**:
  - Changed from base64 streaming to file download system
  - Created separate preview directory for voice files
  - Added proper file cleanup and management
  - Updated frontend to use download URLs instead of base64 data
  - Added support for multiple concurrent previews
- **Result**: Voice previews are now faster and can be used simultaneously

## Troubleshooting

- If TTS fails: Check that pyttsx3 is installed and working
- If video generation fails: Ensure ffmpeg is installed and accessible
- If face animation fails: The system will create static videos as fallback
- If system gets stuck: Use the reset API endpoint or restart the system
- Check the terminal output for detailed error messages

## System Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- ffmpeg (for video processing)
- Required Python packages (installed automatically)
- Optional: Wav2Lip setup for advanced face animation

The system is now much more robust and should work reliably without the previous issues!
