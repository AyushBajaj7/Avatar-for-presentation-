# Progress Tracking Improvements

## Problem Fixed
The system was getting stuck because it didn't properly track when each step was completed, causing it to think previous processes were still running.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. ✅ Individual Slide Progress Tracking
- **Audio Generation**: Now shows "Generating audio for slide X/Y" with real-time progress
- **Face Animation**: Now shows "Animating face for slide X/Y" with real-time progress  
- **Video Composition**: Now shows "Composing video for slide X/Y" with real-time progress

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Status Updates
- Added `update_status()` method to all processors
- Status updates are sent to frontend in real-time
- Progress percentages are calculated and updated for each slide
- Current step is clearly displayed with slide numbers

### 3. ✅ Progress Ranges
- **Step 1**: Extract slides (5%)
- **Step 2**: Render images (15%)
- **Step 3**: Generate audio (25-40%) - per slide progress
- **Step 4**: Animate faces (50-75%) - per slide progress
- **Step 5**: Compose video (75-95%) - per slide progress
- **Step 6**: Concatenate final video (95-100%)

### 4. ✅ System Instance References
- All processors now have references to the main system
- Status updates are sent directly to the global processing status
- Frontend receives real-time updates every 2 seconds

## How It Works Now

### Terminal Output Example:
```
Step 3: Generating audio...
Processing slide 1/5 (Progress: 25%)
Status updated: 25% - Generating audio for slide 1/5
SUCCESS: Audio generated for slide 1
Processing slide 2/5 (Progress: 28%)
Status updated: 28% - Generating audio for slide 2/5
SUCCESS: Audio generated for slide 2
...
```

### Frontend Display:
- Shows current step with slide numbers
- Displays progress percentage
- Updates every 2 seconds
- No more getting stuck on "Generating audio..." or "Animating faces..."

## Benefits

1. **No More Stuck States**: System properly tracks completion of each step
2. **Clear Progress**: Users can see exactly which slide is being processed
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Frontend shows live progress updates
4. **Better Debugging**: Terminal logs show detailed step-by-step progress
5. **Predictable Behavior**: System moves forward only when previous step is complete

## Technical Implementation

- Added `set_system_instance()` method to all processors
- Added `update_status()` method for real-time status updates
- Modified batch processing to update status for each slide
- Connected all processors to the main system for status coordination
- Enhanced logging with slide numbers and progress percentages

The system will no longer get stuck and will provide clear, real-time feedback on exactly what it's doing!
